Tic Tac Toe
==================

Social Tic-Tac-Toe application for android. Allows 2 or more players to play Tic-Tac-Toe via
a client/server connection. I programmed the server myself and it follows the Reactor pattern. Multiple users can connect and are put into a "Waiting Room" when connected. When a user wants to play against someone they click on the username (currently hardcoded but will fix this whenever I have time) of whoever they want to play and a the opponant will be asked if they want to play against said user. If they say yes they will enter a game where the user who proposed the game plays first.
